    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      We love Greek food in our home! I have the best recipe for Greek Chicken
      Gyros with homemade tzatziki sauce. Everyone always rates this recipe 5
      stars! I also share how to make homemade Greek Chicken Bowls with Greek
      Salad on a bowl of rice. Delicious! If you are looking for an easy and
      flavor-packed Greek Pasta Salad full of fresh vegetables, this is the
      recipe for you! You can also pair it with a classic GREEK SALAD.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Chicken -- use your favorite type of chicken -- breast, thighs, tenders,
        or thinly sliced chicken breast. The tenders and thinly sliced chicken
        breast will cook faster
      </li>
      <li>Extra-Virgin Olive Oil</li>
      <li>
        Lemon Juice -- I suggest using freshly squeezed lemon juice from two
        lemons for true, fresh lemon flavor
      </li>
      <li>Garlic</li>
      <li>Oregano</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>Optional: Greek Yogurt</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to make Greek Chicken Marinade</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Whisk together the marinade ingredients in a bowl.</strong> Add
        chicken to large Ziploc bag and pour marinade on top. To ensure the
        marinade penetrates into the chicken, use a fork to make tiny holes in
        the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate for at least 60 minutes </strong>but I suggest at least
        3-5 hours for maximum flavor and the juiciest chicken
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >To grill the Greek chicken, set your grill at medium heat.
        </strong>
        Allow it to preheat before adding the marinated chicken. To keep the
        Greek chicken from sticking, brush a bit of oil on the grill. Cook for
        about 5 - 6 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the chicken
        breast. The chicken needs to reach 165 degrees to ensure that it is
        completely cooked through. I suggest buying a meat thermometer for
        accuracy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Allow the chicken to rest for at least 5-10 minutes </strong> to
        keep the juices inside the chicken.
      </li>
