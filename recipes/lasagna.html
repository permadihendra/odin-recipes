    <h2>Classic Lasagna Recipe</h2>

    <p>
      The perfect lasagna recipe made with parmesan ricotta cheese filling,
      melted mozzarella cheese, ...
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 small Onion ((finely diced))</li>
      <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder ((or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced))</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How To Make The Best Home Made Lasagna</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Start by making a homemade meat sauce.</strong> This is done by
        sautéing an onion in olive oil until it begins to soften. This brings
        out the sweet flavor of the onion. Then it is time to brown the ground
        beef until it is browned and the onion is softened. Stir in the marinara
        sauce and let it simmer on low. If you want your lasagna to be extra
        saucy, I suggest adding ½ jar more marinara sauce
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make a parmesan ricotta cheese mixture.</strong> This is what
        gives the lasagna the creamy filling. I love to flavor the ricotta
        cheese with a good amount of parmesan cheese, spices, and egg to bind it
        together
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Use your favorite lasagna noodles.</strong> There are two
        choices for lasagna noodles -- oven-ready pre-cooked noodles or lasagna
        noodles that need to be cooked before hitting the oven. I have tried
        both ways and can attest that they both work!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bring on the cheese!</strong> The best lasagna is full of cheese
        so be generous with the layers of mozzarella cheese
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake covered for 15 minutes </strong> and then remove the foil
        and continue to cook until the cheese is bubbly. Let it set up for 10
        minutes before serving.
