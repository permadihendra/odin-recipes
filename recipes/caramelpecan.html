    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>

      of a gourmet bakery but are made at home for a fraction of the price!

      certain tips and tricks to making perfect caramel pecan rolls. Making
      homemade bread, rolls, sticky buns, or cinnamon rolls can be intimidating

      baking with my Mother and she has shared her many years of baking wisdom

    <h3>How to make Caramel Pecan Roll</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong
          >In a large bowl, Bosch mixing bowl, or KitchenAid mixer, whisk the
          eggs until mixed together.
        </strong>
        Add brown sugar, buttermilk, yeast, and melted butter. Whisk together.
        Sprinkle in flour and salt. Stir until a ball of dough forms together
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >If making by hand in a bowl, remove the dough from the bowl and place
          on a lightly floured surface.</strong
        >
        Knead for 2-3 minutes. If using a Bosch or KitchenAid, mix for two
        minutes on a medium speed. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise
        until double in size, about two hours
      </li>
      <li>
        <string
          >In a small saucepan, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium
          heat, until it is completely dissolved and beginning to bubble, about
          2 minutes.</string
        >
        Pour in the buttermilk or cream (be careful as it may splatter) and
        pecans. Stir until the caramel mixture is smooth and mixed together.
        Pour into the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar and cinnamon together.</strong
        >
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Turn the raised dough onto a lightly floured surface.</strong>
        Roll into a rectangle that is approximately 16 inches long and 12 inches
        wide. Brush with melted butter. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar mixture
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Roll the dough up into a tight cylinder. </strong>Pinch the seam
        shut and turn the dough so it is seam-side down. Use a very sharp knife
        to cut into 12 slices. Place facing up in prepared dish with caramel
        pecan filling on the bottom. Cover with plastic wrap and let double in
        size, about 2 hours. After the rising process, the rolls should be puffy
        and touch each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>While the dough is rising, preheat oven to 350 degrees. </strong
        >Bake until rolls are puffed up and cooked through, about 24-28 minutes.
        Watch carefully as the rolls can brown quickly. Allow to rest for 5
        minutes, then invert the sticky buns onto a serving platter. Scrape the
        rest of the filling all over the sticky buns. Serve.
